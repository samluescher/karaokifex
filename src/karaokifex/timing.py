"""Time lyric lines (lrclib) word by word — pure functions, no I/O.

The lyrics decide *what* is displayed and how it is split into lines; the audio
decides *when* each word is sung. Several sources of word times are combined,
best first:

- `lrc-tag`: enhanced-LRC word tags, mapped onto the video's timeline;
- `forced`: wav2vec2 forced alignment of the known lyric line inside its window;
- `whisper`: words whisperx heard, paired with lyric words by a DP sequence
  alignment (only inside the line's window, so a repeated chorus is matched to
  the right occurrence);
- `lrc-line` / `interpolated`: everything else, packed into the voiced parts
  of the gap it falls in.

`plan_alignment` first maps lrclib's timeline onto the video's (mapping.py),
derives a search window per line and finds lines that were cut from the video.
The lead-vocal activity (activity.py), when given, vetoes timings: heard words in
silence are dropped, words don't start in silence, and held notes last until
the singing stops.
